# ShadowDoom

A fantasy console game that I made using Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
  - Pygame
  - Rich
  - Tkinter

## Usage

> Clone the repository to your computer:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Sid110307/ShadowDoom.git
Cloning into 'ShadowDoom'...
```

> Enter the directory and run the game:

```sh
$ cd ShadowDoom
$ python3 ShadowDoom.py
# Or just ./ShadowDoom.py for Unix-based systems.
```

> Maximize the terminal window for the best experience.
