# ShadowDoom

A fantasy game that I made using Python (Console-based).

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

  - Pygame

  - Colorama

  - Tkinter

## Usage

> Clone the repository to your computer:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Sid110307/ShadowDoom

Cloning into 'ShadowDoom'...
. . .
```

> Open the `Console` folder in your terminal and type:

```sh
$ python3 ShadowDoom.py
# Or just ./ShadowDoom for Unix-based systems.
```

> Maximize the terminal window for the best experience.
